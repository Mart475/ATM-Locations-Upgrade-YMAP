**[Release] [YMAP] ATM Locations Upgrade.**

---

The ATM Locations Upgrade is a small upgrade of all the ATM locations around San Andreas which adds around 30+ new props. It was created in Codewalker, with careful decisions on where the ATM's were placed. This YMAP is super simple, and adds plenty of life back into the state.
